# pitch-test

Use [GitPitch](https://gitpitch.com/) to create slideshow. 

> It's basically like [revealjs](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/), but simplier. Everything you need for the presentation is served by GitPitch, you just need to create a markdown file that is publically accessible in a git repo.

1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Create a `PITCHME.md` file with some [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) content in it. 
3. Divide slides using `---` for horizontal or `+++` for vertical.
4. View the presentation using the URL pattern: `https://gitpitch.com/user/repo/branch`

e.g. for this demo, <https://gitpitch.com/evanwill/pitch-test/master>
